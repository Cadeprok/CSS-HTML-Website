                <p class="pformat">
                    HTML, also known as Hypertext Markup Language, is a programming language that is used to describe the structure of web pages. HTML has many useful features
                    such as creating static pages with text, creating headings, creating tables, lists, etcetera, and displaying images.

                <h4 class="headingformat">What is CSS?</h4>
                <p class="pformat">
                CSS, also known as cascading style sheets, is a style sheet language that allows an individual to design a webpage. CSS can do things such as set background colors, 
                font colors and sizes, layout of images, paragraphs, headings, etcetera, and much more.

                <h3 class="headingformat">Why learn CSS and HTML?</h3>
                <p class="pformat">
                    Learning CSS and HTML are both both incredibly important programming langauges used primarily for front end web development, which is what the user sees. Learning these langauges will allow you to
                    obtain basic knowledge about creating websites. It is important to understand these languages because they are also needed to understand backend development, which is what the programmer sees.

            <div>
                <h4 class="headingformat">Where should I start?</h4>
                <p class="pformat">
                    The first step to creating a website is to download an IDE, which is an integrated development enviornment. One of the most popular IDE's is visual studio code (the link to the download page can be found at the bottom).
                    On your desktop, create a file called "Website" and open it through visual studio code by clicking "Open" then finding the file through the file explorer.
                </p>
                <img src = "img/NewFileVSC.png" width="600" height="400" alt="NewFileVSC" class = "center">
                <p class="pformat">
                    Once inside your file, create two new files by clicking the piece of paper in the top left of your screen, which is seen in the image on the left.
                    The first one named "index.html" and the second one name "style.css". Examples of how these files can look are shown in the image in the center and 
                    on the left.
                    <br>
                    <div class="container">
                        <img src = "img/NewFileVSC2.png" width="200" height="50" alt="NewFileVSC2" class = "center1">
                        <img src = "img/index.png" width="200" height="50" alt="htmlEx" class = "center1">
                        <img src = "img/style.png" width="200" height="50" alt="CSSex" class = "center1">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                </p>
            </div>  

            <div>
                <h5 class="headingformat">Extensions</h5>
                <p class="pformat">
                    Extensions are incredibly useful tools in coding because they provide services/ capabilities to help extend the capabilites of a program.
                    On visual studio code, there are dozens of extensions that can assist you in developing a website, however the three most important ones are 
                    "Prettier - Code formatter", "Live Server", and "Live Preview".
                    <br>
                    The first step to downloading extensions for the first time is to locate the extension search tab on the far right column of your screen: 
                    <br>
                    <img src = "img/Extensionsearcher.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Extensionsearcher" class="center1">
                    <br>
                    In the search bar, download "Prettier - Code formatter", "Live Server", and "Live Preview".
                    <div class="container">
                        <img src="img/codeformatter.png" width="400" height="80" alt="codeformatter" class="center1">
                        <img src="img/liveserver.png" width="400" height="80" alt="liveserver" class="center1">
                        <img src="img/livepreview.png" width="400" height="80" alt="livepreview" class="center1">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    Now that you've downloaded the extensions stated above and created your files, it's time to code!
