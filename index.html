                <p>
                    HTML, also known as Hypertext Markup Language, is a programming language that is used to describe the structure of web pages. HTML has many useful features
                    such as creating static pages with text, creating headings, creating tables, lists, etcetera, and displaying images.

                <h4 class="headingformat">What is CSS?</h4>
                <p>
                CSS, also known as cascading style sheets, is a style sheet language that allows an individual to design a webpage. CSS can do things such as set background colors, 
                font colors and sizes, layout of images, paragraphs, headings, etcetera, and much more.

                <h3 class="headingformat">Why learn CSS and HTML?</h3>
                <p>
                    Learning CSS and HTML are both both incredibly important programming langauges used primarily for front end web development, which is what the user sees. Learning these langauges will allow you to
                    obtain basic knowledge about creating websites. It is important to understand these languages because they are also needed to understand backend development, which is what the programmer sees.

                <h4 class="headingformat">Where should I start?</h4>
                <p>
                    The first step to creating a website is to download an IDE, which is an integrated development enviornment. One of the most popular IDE's is visual studio code.
                    On your desktop, create a file called "Website" and open it through visual studio code by clicking "Open" then finding the file through the file explorer.
                </p>
                <img src = "img/NewFileVSC.png" width="600" height="400" alt="NewFileVSC" class = "center">
                <p>
                    Once inside your file, create two new files by clicking the piece of paper in the top left of your screen: 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Name of the files "index.html" and another "style.css". <br>
                    Example of how the files might look:
                    <br>
                    <div class="container">
                        <img src = "img/NewFileVSC2.png" width="200" height="50" alt="NewFileVSC2" class = "center">
                        <img src = "img/index.png" width="200" height="50" alt="htmlEx" class = "center">
                        <img src = "img/style.png" width="200" height="50" alt="CSSex" class = "center">
                    </div>
                    <br>
