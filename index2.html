        <p class="pformat">
            The first step to coding HTML is to type the following code. <br>

            <img src="img/doctype.png" class="center">

            &lt--"Information you might need for later--&gt is used for commenting lines of code out, which means that it won't be ran, or for making notes to yourself. 
            Commenting means that whatever is within &lt-- and --&gt will not be visible once the code is ran/ the user.

        <h3 class="headingformat">HTML Elements</h3>
        <p class="pformat">
            The first elements that should be learned are headings and paragraphs.
        </p>
        
        <div class="container">
            <!--input images-->
        </div>
        <br>
        <p class="pformat">
            In order to use links in HTML you must use the a tag and an href attribute, which is used to give more information about that element.
            Between &lta&gt &lt/a&gt you can hyperlink a link.
            Example is shown below:
        </p>

        <div>
            <!-- insert image-->
        </div>

        <p class="pformat">
            In order to use links in HTML, the first step is to create a seperate folder typically named "img" (see images below). Once this is complete, download
            your image and drag and drop if from your file explorer into your images folder. Once this is done, use the img tag to import the image. You can make a placeholder, called "alt" to
            replace the image if it is not valid. You can also change the height and weight of the picture if it is too wide or long.
        </p> 

        <div class="container">
            <!-- Put pictures here -->
        </div>

        <p class="pformat">
            In addition you can also create br tags, which essentially create a blank line. See the example below:
        </p>

        <div>
            <!--Add picture here -->
        </div>

        <p class="pformat">
            Once you understand these topics, you can begin to design your website using CSS!
        </p>
